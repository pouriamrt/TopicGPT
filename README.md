# TopicGPT
TopicGPT integrates the remarkable capabilities of current LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 into topic modelling. 

While traditional topic models extract topics as simple lists of top-words, such as ["Lion", "Leopard", "Rhino", "Elephant", "Buffalo"], TopicGPT offers rich and dynamic topic representations that can be intuitively understood, extensively investigated and modified in various ways via a simple text commands in natural language. 

More specifically, it provides the following core functionalities: 
- Identification of clusters within document-embeddings and top-word extraction
- Generation of informative topic descriptions 
- Extraction of detailed information about topics via Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG)
- Comparison of topics
- Splitting and combining of identified topics
- Addition of new topics based on keywords
- Deletion of topics
  
When directly interacting with TopicGPT via prompting and without explicitly calling  functions, an LLM autonomously decides which functionality to use.
